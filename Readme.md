## 🧠 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how insecure IoT communication can be transformed into a secure TLS-encrypted architecture using MQTT.

Many IoT devices transmit data without encryption, allowing attackers to intercept or modify messages.  
This implementation introduces:

✅ TLS encryption  
✅ Certificate-based authentication  
✅ Secure MQTT communication (Port 8883)  
✅ Real packet analysis using Wireshark  

---

## ⚠️ Problem Statement

Standard MQTT uses port **1883**, where data is transmitted in plaintext.

This leads to:

- Packet sniffing
- Credential exposure
- Man-in-the-Middle attacks

The goal of this project is to secure IoT data pipelines using modern cryptographic techniques.

## 🔑 TLS Certificate Generation

Certificates were generated using OpenSSL to establish mutual authentication.

Certificates Created:

- CA Certificate  
- Broker Certificate  
- Client Certificate

## 🔌 Secure Node-RED MQTT Connection

Node-RED connects to the broker using TLS encryption.

Key Highlights:

- mqtts://localhost:8883  
- Encrypted communication  
- Certificate validation enabled  

---

## 🧪 Insecure Phase — Plaintext MQTT (Before TLS)

Wireshark capture showing readable MQTT payload.

Observation:

- JSON sensor data visible  
- No encryption  
- High vulnerability  

---

## 🔒 Secure Phase — Encrypted MQTT (After TLS)

Wireshark capture after enabling TLS.

Observation:

- TLSv1.2 Application Data  
- Encrypted payload  
- MITM protection

## 📊 Results

| Phase | Port | Encryption | Packet Visibility |
|---|---|---|---|
| Insecure MQTT | 1883 | ❌ No | Plaintext |
| Secure MQTTS | 8883 | ✅ TLS | Encrypted |
